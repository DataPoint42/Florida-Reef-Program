## Florida's Artifical Reef Program

As an avid Scuba scuba diver, I have a particular interest in helping coral reefs develop and mature into healthy habitats. 

"Florida has one of the most active artificial reef programs among the 15 Gulf and Atlantic coastal states involved in artificial reef development. Since the 1940s, more than 3,330 planned public artificial reefs have been placed in state and federal waters off Florida’s coast. The FWC Artificial Reef Program provides financial and technical assistance to coastal local governments, nonprofit corporations and state universities to construct, monitor and assess artificial reefs." 

Artificial reefs are beneficial for multiple reasons including:

    Enhancing recreational and diving opportunities
    Providing socio-economic benefits to local coastal communities
    Increasing reef fish habitat
    Mitigation reefs to replace hard bottom habitat lost through activities such as beach re-nourishment and damage caused by vessel groundings
    Oyster reef regeneration
    Shoreline protection

Please reference “Understanding the Ecology of Artificial Reefs: No Simple Answers” for a more detailed Q&A on Artificial Reef benefits.
