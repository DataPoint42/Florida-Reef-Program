# Florida's Artifical Reef Program

As an avid Scuba scuba diver, I have a particular interest in helping coral reefs develop and mature into healthy habitats. 

"Florida has one of the most active artificial reef programs among the 15 Gulf and Atlantic coastal states involved in artificial reef development. Since the 1940s, more than 3,330 planned public artificial reefs have been placed in state and federal waters off Floridaâ€™s coast. The FWC Artificial Reef Program provides financial and technical assistance to coastal local governments, nonprofit corporations and state universities to construct, monitor and assess artificial reefs."

## Allowable materials include:

- Concrete material
- Limestone boulders
- Heavy- gage steel (1/4 inch thick minimum)

Allowable materials for artificial reef use are determined by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) and Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) permit criteria. Deployed material is required to be heavy, stable, durable and non-polluting  and provided long-term habitat enhancement.

Please reference [Guidelines for Marine Artificial Reef Materials, 2nd Edition (2004), GSMFC (2004)](https://myfwc.com/media/4892/artificialreefmaterialsguidelines.pdf), produced by the Gulf and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commissions for additional information.




## Artificial reefs are beneficial for multiple reasons including:

- Enhancing recreational and diving opportunities
- Providing socio-economic benefits to local coastal communities
- Increasing reef fish habitat
- Mitigation reefs to replace hard bottom habitat lost through activities such as beach re-nourishment and damage caused by vessel groundings
- Oyster reef regeneration
- Shoreline protection
